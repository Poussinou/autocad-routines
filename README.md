# AutoCAD Routines

These are some AutoLISP routines that I wrote back in the day while doing drafting and survey work.

## Note

I am leaving these here mostly for nostalgia. I wrote these scripts starting when I was thirteen while teaching myself to program AutoLISP. There is no guarantee as to whether they still work. These files will not be maintained or updated. Also, there may be one or two scripts that aren't mine, but I can't even remember.
